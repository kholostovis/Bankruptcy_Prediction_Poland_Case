# bankruptcy-prediction
Bankruptcy prediction is the task of predicting bankruptcy and various indicators of the financial distress of firms, and is important because of its relevance to creditors and investors when assessing the likelihood that a firm may go bankrupt.

The goal of predicting a financial crisis is to develop a predictive model that combines various econometric parameters to predict the financial condition of a firm. In this project, we document our observations by examining, building, and comparing some widely used classification models:
1. Decision Tree
2. Random Forest
3. Gradient Boosting

I began with data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis where I introduced missing data values using some popular data imputation method and finally I analyzed and evaluated the performance of models on validation datasets using multiple metrics like precision, accuracy, recall, f1_score, and rank the models accordingly.
